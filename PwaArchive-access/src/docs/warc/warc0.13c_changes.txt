		"Classic" WARC 0.13c -- Changes from WARC 0.10

			Driver: John Kunze, jak@ucop.edu


||| Introduction to "Classic" WARC 0.13c3

This revision is in ISO (MSWord) format as opposed to the usual Internet
Draft format because of the urgent need not to further delay the work of
the ISO committee.  This draft is called 0.13c (c=classic).

The 0.13c draft incorporates the additions, testing, and debugging work
that Michael Stack did in preparation for the 0.10 draft, which includes
fixing the ambiguity spotted by Mads Alhof Kristiansen (section 4.8.1 of
'Digital Preservation using the WARC file format').

MSWord "Track changes" was turned on.  The Internet-Draft equivalent has
NOT yet been prepared.

This draft tries to simplify, clarify, and tighten the spec compared with
previous drafts, as well as fix some latent bugs.  Non-trivial surgery
was used to restructure things, hopefully with a healthy result.  Comments
are welcome.

||| Major changes from the WARC 0.11 Draft

+ Minor edits confirming that all of Michael Stack's 0.9-to-0.10 changes
  were applied from the Internet-Draft presentation to the MSWord
  ISO-style presentation.  This included clarifying the content-type and
  adding a reference to RFC2616 (HTTP 1.1).

+ Made ref-uri optional in the 'revisit' qualifier and added a truncation
  reason of "unspecified", inspired by discussion comments from Gordon Mohr.

+ Not done: the 0.10 draft changed the warc record start from 'warc/...'
  to 'WARC/...'.  I don't (a) remember it being discussed, (b) like the
  shift key, and (c) understand what problem it solves.


||| Major changes from the ISO and 0.10 Drafts

|| Changes to the header-line

+ Header-line is shorter and more predictable, containing those elements
  that are absolutely common to all records or that can be corrected at
  relatively low cost later after the true size of a record is learned
  (the cost applies to those writing a WARC record as one long string):

    warc/JJ.NN data-length creation-date record-id segment-status 
  
  As before, variable whitespace can occur between tokens, so data-length
  can be adjusted if it's unknown at the time of writing the header-line.

+ Segmentation/Truncation is moved into the header-line as segment-status
  to make it easier to adjust since for some writers the decision to
  segment or truncate won't be taken until after the header was written.
  Going back to tweak a few chars of the header-line is much easier than
  reserving extensive header padding for the long named fields recording
  segmentation/truncation decisions in versions 0.10 and earlier.  The
  segment-status looks like CM, where M is a postive segment number and

   C=p  partial - this segment (M) is part of a still incomplete record
   C=w  whole - this segment (M) ends the record, which is complete
   C=t  truncated - M ends the record, truncated due to a time constraint
   C=z  truncated - M ends the record, truncated due to a size constraint
   C=x  truncated - M ends the record, truncated for an unspecified reason

  The common case would be a header-line ending in "w1" ("whole in one").

+ Record type is moved into a named field, where it takes parameters
  according to its type (see below), eg, subject-uri makes sense for
  certain types but not for others.  A parameter-less "data" type has
  been added to accommodate truly generic content.

+ Content-type is move to a named field, and can therefore now contain
  whitespace without inventing a special tokenizing exception kludge
  implied by moving it to the last token on the header-line.

+ The warc version now has fixed-width major (JJ) and minor (NN) numbers,
  to speed pattern recognition (via greater determinism about string
  length), eg, when using ubiquitous tools such as "grep"; for a record
  to start it is necessary (but not sufficient) to see warc/\d\d\.\d\d\s .


|| Changes to record types

+ A named field holds the record types plus parameters specific to a type.

+ Some of those types begged what used to be a Related-Record-ID, which
  has been added as a parameter, but can be left unspecified.  This is
  advantageous because the related record's relationship can now be
  implied by the record type parameter, whereas the relationship couldn't
  be identified at all in the former Related-Record-ID.

+ Request and response types have been narrowed.  We don't really know
  how other protocols work.  We can speculate and forecast, but that's
  not appropriate in the context of a standard.  Record types in this
  spec are therefore limited to what we _know_ how to do:

    type: warcinfo
    type: http-response uri
    type: http-request response-uri
    	where response-uri references the matching response record
    type: dns-response dns-uri
        (though we know how to do it, type:dns-request isn't interesting)
    type: metadata ref-uri
        where ref-uri references the matching resource
    type: conversion ref-uri flag
        where ref-uri references the matching resource, and flag is a
	place to signal the overwhelmingly common expected case in which
	the record is not actually converted, but only the payload
	inside an http-response is converted.
    type: data
        default if no type is given, also the former 'resource' type

+ Added a missing feature to the 'conversion' type, which didn't deal
  with the very common case that virtually all web harvested material
  will be labeled with the type application/http, when actually, the real
  type is revealed only after stripping off the http response headers.
  This common action is flagged with an "noenvelope" parameter.

+ 'Revisit' is no longer a distinguished record type, but a named field
  that may qualify any record type (in principle, but like any named
  field you shouldn't combine it with fields that create nonsense):

    revisit: ref-uri comparison
        where ref-uri references the original content and
        comparison=same, comparison=different, or comparison=patch

  The content block would be empty or free text unless comparison=patch,
  in which case you can use the content block to construct the resource
  from the original resource.

+ In these transitions, it seemed to make sense to generalize
  Related-Record-ID to Related-Resource.  The reasoning is that the
  relationship can be to any content that is reasonably stable, and
  that could be any archival content whether held in a WARC file or not.


|| General changes

+ Rather than leave metadata unspecified, added a simple concrete example
  of a default format (ie, same as the WARC named field format) for the
  metadata record type.

+ Rather than leave conversion, revisit, and warcinfo largely unspecified,
  laid down some concrete ways to capture some important cases.

+ Tried to reduce overloading parameters which would change character
  significantly depending on the record type.  For example, the old
  headerline subject-uri had no meaning for metadata and warcinfo type
  records, and had a different role between HTTP and DNS requests.
  Also, Content-Type would vary from credible but not very interesting
  (application/http), to unreliable (Resource record with type reported
  by a web server), to crucial but undefined (metadata, conversion,
  revisit records).

+ Movement of sections as per Michael:  some reordering of text putting
  positional parameter text under positional parameter section and same
  for named parameter text.

+ Moved examples from Annexes into the sections being exemplified.

Most of Michael Stack's Internet Draft changes were added to the ISO
document Word file, but sometimes with a different flavor, including

+ Mimetype can include parameters -- no longer is it just type/subtype.
  However, this is achieved by using a named field for content-type as
  opposed to creating an exception to the normal tokenizing rule for the
  header-line.  Therefore, this draft does not swap postions of the
  record-id and mimetype in positional parameters.
+ Changed suggested http capture type from message/http to application/http.
+ Convert dns-uri draft references to rfc4501.
+ Changed recommended size to 1GB from 500MB.
+ Changed ANVL ABNF, and removed references to ANVL after moving the ABNF
  inline.  Changed LWSP-char define to rfc2234 WSP.
+ Explained "patch".
+ Removed a few instances where we say "...but in the future this
  could be all different".
+ Simplified encoding considerations for type application/warc.  Declared
  it as format 'binary' and removed text on UTF-8 in textual part but
  binary in others, etc.
+ Fixed the ambiguity identified in '4.8.1 A note on the specification'
  from 'Digital Preservation using the WARC file format' by Mads Alhof
  Kristiansen.


|| Still To Do 

+ Consistently use single-quotes rather than sometimes double, then single.
+ Consistently use Camel-Case and hyphenation.
+ Spellcheck.
