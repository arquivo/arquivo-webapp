<section name="Development setup in Eclipse"> 

<p>Here are vitals on setting up an eclipse development environment for
nutchwax.
</p>
<subsection name="nutch">
<p>Add the nutch project to eclipse. I had trouble trying to import
symlinked nutch -- the <code>.classpath</code> and <code>.project</code> weren't written --
so go against an actual directory.  There also seems to be an
issue if the directory is named say <code>nutch-trunk</code> when the project name in
the <code>build.xml</code> (or <code>.project</code> file) is Nutch.  Make them the same.</p>  
<p>I created the new project by
doing import using the ant build.xml.  This does not import all plugins nor does
it add in the necessary conf directory.  Here is a sample .classpath:
<a href="classpath">.classpath</a>.  I have eclipse build into the <code>target</code> subdir.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="nutchwax">
<p>Nutchwax has a <code>.classpath</code> and <code>.project</code> already.  These should just work as
is (They build to the <code>target</code> subdir).  It depends on a project named 'nutch'
being present in the eclipse environment.
</p>
<p>So plugins can be found, I added following full-paths to the plugin
directories in the nutchwax hadoop-site.xml under nutchwax/conf:
<pre>
&lt;property>
  &lt;name>plugin.folders&lt;/name>
  &lt;value>/home/stack/workspace/nutchwax/src/plugin,/home/stack/workspace/nutch/src/plugin&lt;/value>
&lt;/property>
</pre>
</p>
<p>That should do it.</p>
