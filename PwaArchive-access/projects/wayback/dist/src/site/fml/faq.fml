      <question>
            What is this project all about?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
	        The project is designed to replace the current Wayback Machine with an
	        all Java solution that is flexible enough to provide an easy-to-use 
	        solution for the single-machine at-home user, as well as scaling up
	        to hundreds of machines for a full historical collection.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Primarily it is a few easily replaceable interfaces, and some core 
	        classes that utilize those interfaces to provide the Wayback 
	        service. Presently only trivial implementations of those interfaces
	        have been developed, but we hope that these interfaces will allow a
			high degree of flexibility and experimentation.
