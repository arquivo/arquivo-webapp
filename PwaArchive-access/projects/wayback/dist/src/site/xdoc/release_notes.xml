      <subsection name="Features">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now explicitly sets the <b>charset</b> component of replayed HTML
            page <b>Content-Type</b> HTTP headers in Archival URL mode. This
            overrides Tomcat's default behavior of explicitly setting this value
            to Tomcat's <b>default</b> encoding character set, if a document 
            does not set it explicitly. The original <b>Content-Type</b> HTTP
            header value is now returned as HTTP header
            <b>X-Wayback-Orig-Content-Type</b>.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>auto-indexer</b> now closes ARC/WARC files after indexing, fixing

          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            fixed problem which prevented captures archived after webapp was

          </li>
          <li>
            initial revision of "deduplicated" WARC record handling, which
            returns the last version that was actually stored when 
            subsequent captures are not saved because they have not changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            now filters (literal) duplicate records from the ResourceIndex,
            in case the same capture (url + date) appears twice, or in two
            CDX files.
          </li>
          <li>
            UrlCanonicalizer is now pluggable, current functionality is now
            implemented in AggressiveUrlCanonicalizer. Added
            IdentityUrlCanonicalizer, which performs no canonicalization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>bin-search</b> command line tool now outputs a single stream of 
            sorted results from multiple files, instead of returning matches
            from each file sequentially.
          </li>
          <li>
            extracted several replay features into separate jspInserts that

            non-javascript Archival URL replay mode, where all URL rewriting

            Archival URL replayed documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            now rewrites all <b>background</b> attributes found in returned

          </li>

          <li>
            replay URLs in query results now include non-standard ports, if

            uncaught character-encoding exceptions now handled, plus

          </li>
          <li>
            archival URL parsing of query end-date now assumes latest
            possible date given a partial end-date, instead of earliest
            possible date.
          </li>
          <li>
