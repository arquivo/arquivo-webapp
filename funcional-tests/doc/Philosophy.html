  <h1>Selenium Grid Philosophy</h1>

  <h3>One Remote Control = One browser = One Environment</h3>
    <p>
      The rationale is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This simplifies dramatically the remote control reservation/stickiness process
      <li>Easy to get something out the door quickly if we rely on this assumption on the
      short run
      <li>More than one IE instance for the same remote control does not work
      <li>Remote control is not very stable and need to be restarted quite often.
      The restart has less impact if only one browser is running at a time.
      <li>You can still scale by running multiple remote control on the same machine
      <li>This way each remote control can offer different environment capabilities on the
      same box. e.g "IE 7 on Windows" and "Firefox on Windows".
   </ul>

  <h2>You are the one in control</h2>

    <h3>The same test can run locally on a traditional remote control or remotely on the Selenium grid</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The selenium test can run the same locally with a "classic" selenium setup or talking to the
   selenium grid => Tests are written as usual using your favorite selenium client driver
   (ruby, python, java, ...). This makes it easy to troubleshoot failing tests.
        </li><li>
           The selenium test itself is in charge on test isolation : reusing the same browser across test,
   rolling back database to a known state, etc. This is because the person writing the test
   is the only person who knows what makes sense for a specific web application and which
   tradeoff he is willing to take between test isis the only one
   aware
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Lessons learned</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Remote Control are not very robust, the need to be restarted regularly</li>
      <li>Running more than one IE on a remote control is not a good idea</li>
      <li>
        Two _major_ factors for the performance of your selenium test suite are:
        <ol>
          <li>Performance of the web server under test</li>
          <li>Performance of the network between the remote control and the web site under test</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
