    <p class="note">
      To run the demo against an EC2 instance of Selenium Grid you will need to complete the steps described
      <q><a href="setting_up_selenium_grid_on_ec2.html">Setting Up Selenium Grid on EC2</a></q>.
    </p>
    <p>
	
  <h2>Booting your first Selenium Grid on EC2</h2>

    <p>
	  Go to the <code>examples/ec2</code> directory within the Selenium
	  Grid distribution and check that everything works as expected:
	  </p><pre>cap ec2:check_settings</pre>
	
	<p>
	  Edit the <code>Capfile</code> to reflect the number of EC2 instances
	  that you are willing to launch. The relevant line is
	  </p><pre>set :remote_control_farms_count, 5</pre>
	<p>
	  Boot all your EC2 instances with:
	  </p><pre>cap grid:boot</pre>
	<p>
	  Be patient, booting EC2 instances can take a while...
	</p><p>
      You can then view the current state of your Selenium Grid with
      </p><pre>cap grid:info</pre>
    

  <h2>Starting Selenium Grid Services</h2>
    <p>
	  You can start Selenium Grid Hub, Remote Controls and VNC on the
	  EC2 grid you just booted with:
	  </p><pre>cap grid:start</pre>
	
	
  <h2>Visualizing what is happening</h2>
    <p>
	  You can view the Selenium Grid Hub Console with:
	  </p><pre>cap hub:console</pre>
	<p>
	  You can also VNC to all the Remote Controls with:
	</p>
	<pre>cap rc:view</pre>
    <p>
	  You do not even need the password if you use the "cap rc:view"
      command: This task will detect vncviewer or chicken of VNC on your machine and
      gives the vnc password file directly to the VNC client so that you are
	  not even prompted for any password. Quite handy to open a VNC window
	  for all of your RCs in one command ;-)
	</p>
    <p>
     In case you need it the super secret password is 
     "<code>seleniumgrid</code>" (no double quotes).
     It is stored on EC2 instance in an encrypted form under 
     <code>~/.vnc/password</code>.      
    </p><p>
    <p>
      If you cannot connect, it might be that the VNC servers were not
      started. You can start them with 
    </p>
    <pre>cap rc:vnc:start</pre>

 <h2>Running The demo against the your EC2 Grid</h2>
   <p>
	 To run Selenium tests against the EC2 grid you need to know the
	 DNS name of the Selenium Grid Hub. You can discover it by running:
     </p><pre>cap grid:info</pre>
   <p>
	 From know let's assume the Hub DNS name is 
	<code>ec2-67-202-25-36.compute-1.amazonaws.com</code>
   </p>	
   <p>
	 You can then navigate back to the root of Selenium Grid distribution:
	 </p><pre>cd ../..</pre>
   <p>
	... and run the demo with:
	</p><pre> ant -DseleniumHost=ec2-67-202-25-36.compute-1.amazonaws.com  run-demo-in-parallel</pre>
   <p>
	You can then visualize browsers running the tests in your VNC windows.
   </p>

 <h2>Shutting Down the Grid</h2>
   <p>
	Once you are done experimenting with Selenium Grid on EC2 you can
	shutdown all the EC2 instances (and stop be charged for it) with:
	</p><pre>cap grid:shutdown</pre>
   <p>
	You can double-check that everything has been stopped properly:
	</p><pre>ec2-describe-instances | grep running</pre>
   

  <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>
	  Stay tuned for more documentation on Selenium Grid integration
	  with EC2. In the meantime you can explore other feature by
	  running in the <code>examples/ec2</code> directory:
	  </p><pre>$ cap -T<br>	cap ec2:check_settings # Check EC2 related configuration.<br>	cap grid:boot          # Boot EC2 Instances for a Selenium Grid of 1 Hub and ...<br>	cap grid:info          # Display infoemation about current Selenium Grid<br>	cap grid:shutdown      # Shutdown EC2 Instance used to run Selenium Hub.<br>	cap grid:start         # Start Selenium Grid Hub.<br>	cap grid:stop          # Stop Selenium Grid Hub.<br>	cap hub:boot           # Boot a new EC2 Instance to Run Selenium Grid Hub.<br>	cap hub:console        # Open Selenium Grid Hub Console in a browser.<br>	cap hub:logs           # View Selenium Grid Hub logs.<br>	cap hub:restart        # (Re)start Selenium Grid Hub.<br>	cap hub:shutdown       # Shutdown EC2 Instance used to run Selenium Hub.<br>	cap hub:start          # Start Selenium Grid Hub.<br>	cap hub:stop           # Stop Selenium Grid Hub.<br>	cap invoke             # Invoke a single command on the remote servers.<br>	cap rc:boot            # Boot a new EC2 Instance to run a collection of Selen...<br>	cap rc:restart         # (Re)start Remote Controls for all farms.<br>	cap rc:shutdown        # Shutdown all EC2 Instances used to run Selenium Grid...<br>	cap rc:start           # Start Remote Controls for all farms.<br>	cap rc:stop            # Stop Remote Controls for all farms.<br>	cap rc:view            # Visualize what is happening in Remote Control Farms ...<br>	cap rc:vnc:start       # Start VNC server on all Remote Control Farms<br>	</pre>
