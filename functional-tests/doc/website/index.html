      <p>
      An efficient development cycle requires <strong>prompt and reliable
        feedback</strong>.
        Stop waiting hours to get the results of your web acceptance builds!
        Selenium Grid 
        transparently <strong>distribute your tests on multiple machines</strong>
	      so that you can <strong>run your tests in parallel</strong>, 
	      cutting down the time required for running in-browser test suites.
	      This will <strong>dramatically speeds up
        in-browser web testing</strong>, giving you quick and accurate feedback
        you can rely on to improve your web application.

          <h3>In-Browser Tests Are Slow</h3>
            <p>
              In-browser testing involves a full application stack
              and a flurry of network chats between browsers, web
              servers, databases and other processes. Not 
              surprisingly, this comes with a lot of performance
              overhead. As your application grows, the
              web acceptance build soon takes more than half an hour
              to run, and accounts for a 
              <strong>tremendous delay in the development feedback
              cycle</strong>.
            </p>
          <h3>Maintenance Costs Are The Real Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Using Selenium, it is very easy to write or generate a
              significant number of automated in-browser tests. 
              The real challenge, though, is to keep the maintenance 
              costs low as the application matures, the test suite grows
              and time passes by.
              However valuable the tests are, <strong>it is hard to maintain
              a High ROI for your Selenium test suite if maintenance 
              costs grow exponentially</strong>. We have seen way too many
              test suites requiring full time effort of a
              dedicated QA or developer... just to keep them in the
              green and find more bugs in the test suite itself than in the
              application.
            </p>
          <h3>Prompt and Reliable Feedback is Crucial</h3>
            <p>
              Keeping maintenance costs low is a hard problem which
              can only be solved by a combination of techniques and
              best practices. However, none of them will work if 
              your feedback cycle is slow or plagued with intermittent
              failures. <strong>Prompt and efficient feedback is the key to
                experimentation, innovation and improvement</strong>.
            </p><p>
              Even worse than slow, <strong>without a fast feedback loop you will end up 
              chasing a (broken) Selenium build</strong> as your development 
              team cranks out new functionality faster than build
              failures can be diagnosed and fixed.
            </p>
          <h3>Hardware is Cheap</h3>
            <p>
              In-browser tests are inherently slow, but since commodity
              hardware is insanely cheap nowadays there is no
              excuse for not <strong>running all these tests in parallel on
              multiple machines and dramatically speeding up your feedback
              cycle. This is exactly what Selenium Grid is about</strong>.
            </p><p>
              You do not even need to build or purchase an expensive
              server farm: in our experience <strong>a couple of Mac Minis or Linux
                Boxes can go a long way</strong> and help you keep your build
              under 10 minutes.
            </p><p>
              If your CPU use is intermittent or politics make it hard to buy
              new machines, <strong>Selenium Grid also comes with support, out-of-the-box, for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon's EC2</a></strong>, 
              a cloud-computing service which provides flexible and cheap on-demand 
              computing resources.

        <p>Concepts and Architecture</p>
        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li><a href="how_it_works.html">How it Works</a></li>
          </ul>
         <p>Selenium Grid is a tool that dramatically speeds up functional 
          testing of web-apps by leveraging your existing computing infrastructure. 
          It allows you to easily run multiple tests in parallel, on multiple
          machines, in an heterogeneous enviroment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the excellent 
          <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> web 
          testing tool, Selenium Grid allows you to run multiple instances 
          of Selenium Remote Control in parallel. Even better, it makes all 
          these Selenium Remote Controls appear as a single one, so your tests 
          do not have to worry about the actual infrastructure. Selenium Grid
          cuts down on the time required to run a Selenium test suite to a 
          fraction of the time that a single instance of Selenium instance 
          would take to run.
        </p><p>
	      Of course, you get to choose which language you develop your tests
	      in: Ruby, Java, Python, C#, PHP, ... 
		</p><p>
          Last but not least, Selenium Grid is easy to use and simple to install.

        <p>Your First Steps with Selenium Grid</p>
        <div class="content">
	      <h3>Installing Selenium Grid</h3>
            <p>
              In <q><a href="get_started.html">Setup Your Environment</a></q>
              you will learn everything on how to install Selenium Grid and
              its required dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              If for some reason you need a previous distribution of
              Selenium Grid, you can find them on the
              <a href="download.html">download page</a>.
            </p>

         <h3>Run the Demo</h3>
           <p>
             Before you use Selenium Grid on your own project, I recommend that
             you acquire some practical experience with its mechanics and 
             management scripts by <a href="run_the_demo.html">Running The Demo</a>
             on your local machine.
	       </p><p>
             Once everything is working, you can then decide to 
             <a href="run_the_demo_on_ec2.html">Run The Demo on EC2</a>, if
             you are interested in the cloud computing capabilities.

         <h3>Examples Bundled in Selenium Grid Distribution</h3>
           <p>
             Selenium Grid bundles Java and Ruby examples, which provide a great
             starting point to adapt your Selenium Test Suite to Selenium Grid.
             Make sure you review them, they are located in the <code>examples</code>
             directory in Selenium Grid root installation directory.
