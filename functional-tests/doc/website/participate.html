        You can help a lot by using Selenium Grid and reporting problems that
        you find. You can file any bug you discover using 
        <a href="http://jira.seleniumhq.org/browse/GRID">our bug tracking tool</a>.

        If you have a talent for graphics or web design we can use some help.
        We have plenty of ideas for logos or little cartoons related to
        Selenium Grid but none of us are up to the task. We also welcome 
        alternative designs for this website (we favor simple and to the point,
        but we also do not mind esthetics and fun). Please
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">contact us</a> if 
        you feel that you can contribute in that area!

      <p>
        Help us improve the existing documentation and create new content.
        Clear and well written documentation harnessing collective knowledge 
        is a terrific asset for any community.
